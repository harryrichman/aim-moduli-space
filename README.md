# Topology and geometry of the moduli space of curves


- March 28 to April 1, 2005

- American Institute of Mathematics Research Conference Center

- Palo Alto, California

## Description:

This workshop, sponsored by AIM and the NSF, will be devoted to 
bringing the communities of topologists and algebraic geometers
together. The aim is to have an active exchange of results, techniques
and ideas on the cohomology of the moduli spaces of curves.

Specific topics to be addressed include:

   1. Integral cohomology, stable and unstable.
   2. Tautological cohomology of the compactified moduli space.
   3. Applications to Gromov-Witten theory. 

The workshop is organized by
Ulrike Tillmann and Ravi Vakil.

## AIM Research Conference Center (ARCC):

The AIM Research Conference Center (ARCC) hosts focused
workshops in all areas of the mathematical sciences. ARCC
focused workshops are distinguished by their emphasis on
a specific mathematical goal, such as making progress on a
significant unsolved problem, understanding the proof of an
important new result, or investigating the convergence between
two distinct areas of mathematics.
