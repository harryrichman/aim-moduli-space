The tautological ring ![$ R^*(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img184.png) is the subring of the the Chow ring ![$ A^*(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n})$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img185.png) which is meant to contain all of the natural geometric information. Faber and Pandharipande gave the following elegant formulation (which is equivalent to previous definitions). There are forgetful morphisms ![$ \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n} \to \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n-1}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img186.png) and gluing morphisms ![$ \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+1}\times \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{h,m+1} \to \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g+h,n+m}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img187.png) and ![$ \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n+2} \to \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g+1,n}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img188.png). The system of tautological rings is then the smallest system of ![$ \mathbb{Q}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img189.png)-subalgebras of the Chow rings which is closed under the gluing and pushforward maps and which contains all of the Witten classes ![$ \psi_i$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img75.png). Tautological rings for the uncompactified moduli space and its partial compactifications are defined by restriction.
