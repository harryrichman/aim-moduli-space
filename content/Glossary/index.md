This glossary contains brief definitions and explanations of many technical terms that arise is the study of the moduli space of curves. It was produced as part of the activities during the Topology and Geometry of the Moduli space of Curves workshop in March 2005; it is a component of a larger resource site at [http://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/](http://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/)
