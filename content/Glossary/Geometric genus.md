title: Geometric genus
---

The *geometric genus* of a smooth connected curve $C$ is what one expects and can be defined in many ways, e.g. $\frac{1}{2}\dim H^1(C)$. For an irreducible, singular curve, the geometric genus is then defined to be the genus of its normalization (the curve obtained by ungluing all the nodes).
