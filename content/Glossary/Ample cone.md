Suppose $X$ is a projective variety, with $\pi : X \hookrightarrow \mathbb P^n$ an inclusion (a "closed immersion"). Projective space has a natural line bundle $\mathcal O(1)$, and the pullback $\pi^* \mathcal O(1)$ is said to be a *very ample* line bundle on $X$. That is, a line bundle is very ample if it can be obtained by pulling back $\mathcal O(1)$ via a closed immersion into projective space. Equivalently, a line bundle is very ample if its global sections $s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_n$ determine a closed immersion into projective space $[s_0, s_1, \ldots, s_n] : X \hookrightarrow \mathbb P^n$. The tensor product of two very ample line bundles is again very ample.

A line bundle on a projective variety is *ample* if some tensor power of it is very ample. The ample cone is the convex cone in $H^2(X, \mathbb Q)$ generated by $\{c_1(L) : L \text{ an ample line bundle on } X\}$.

The ampleness of a line bundle $L$ is determined only by its first Chern class. More precisely, a line bundle $L$ is ample if and only if, for every subvariety $Z$, where $\dim Z = k$, we have $c_1(L)^k \cap [Z] > 0$.
