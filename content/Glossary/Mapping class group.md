title: Mapping class group
---

Given a Riemann surface $F_{g,n}$ of genus $g$ with $n$ boundary components, the *mapping class group* $\Gamma_{g,n}$ is the group of diffeomorphisms of $F_{g,n}$ which fix the boundary pointwise, modulo the subgroup of diffeomorphisms isotopic to the identity. Equivalently, it is the group of connected components $\pi_0
\mathrm{Diff}(F_{g,n})$.
