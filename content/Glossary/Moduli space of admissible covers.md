title: Moduli space of admissible covers
---

Admissible covers were developed by Harris and Morrison. The space of [[Admissible covers|admissible covers]] is a modular compactification of the [[Hurwitz schemes|Hurwitz scheme]] obtained by allowing the target ![$ \mathbf{P}^{1}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img91.png) to degenerate when branch points approach each other. The map ![$ \mathcal{H}_{d,g}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}_{g}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img123.png) given by forgetting the map to ![$ \mathbf{P}^{1}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img91.png) extends to a map ![$ \overline{\mathcal{H}}_{d,g}
\rightarrow \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img124.png).

A different compactification of the Hurwitz scheme was given by Abramovich and Vistoli. Their compactification has two advantages: (i) it is smooth, and (ii) it is a moduli space. The disadvantage is that is is a Deligne-Mumford stack rather than a scheme.
