The boundary of $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g, n}$ is the complement of the open subset $\mathcal M_{g, n}$. It is of pure (complex) codimension $1$. It consists of irreducible components $\Delta_i$, $i = 0, 1, \ldots, \lfloor g / 2 \rfloor$ where a generic curve in $\Delta_0$ is a (geometric) genus $g - 1$ curve with a single node and a generic curve in $\Delta_i$, $i \neq 0$, consists of a genus $i$ curve attached to a genus $g - i$ curve at a single node. Each boundary divisor is a finite-group quotient of a product of $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g', n'}$'s for $g' < g$ and $n' \leq n + 1$. The subspace $\overline{\mathcal M}_g - \Delta_0$ is called the locus of *curves of compact type*.
