title: String equation

Given a [[Gromov-Witten invariants|Gromov-Witten invariant]] involving $n+1$ marked points but with no constraints on the last point, the *string equation* expresses this in terms of invariants with fewer marked points. It is equivalent to annihilation by the differential operator $L_{-1}$ in the [[Virasoro conjecture]]. (The string equation is a known fact; this part of the Virasoro conjecture is a proved theorem.)
