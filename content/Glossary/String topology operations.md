title: String topology operations

These are operations on the homology and $S^{1}$-equivariant homology of the free loop space of a manifold $M$ defined via intersection theory. For example, using these operations, $H_{\ast}(LM)$ has the structure of a graded commutative algebra and a graded Lie algebra.
