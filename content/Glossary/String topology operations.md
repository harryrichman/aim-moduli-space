title: String topology operations

These are operations on the homology and ![$ S^{1}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img171.png)-equivariant homology of the free loop space of a manifold ![$ M$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img41.png) defined via intersection theory. For example, using these operations, ![$ H_{\ast}(LM)$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img172.png) has the structure of a graded commutative algebra and a graded Lie algebra.
