title: Slope conjecture
---

The slope conjecture is about the possible homology classes of hypersurfaces in the moduli space of curves. Given an effective line bundle $L$](https://10.png) on $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g}$](https://173.png), we can find non-negative $a,b_{i}$](https://174.png) for which

![$\displaystyle c_{1}(L) = a\lambda - b_{0}\delta_{0} \dots -b_{[g/2]}\delta_{[g/2]}
\in H^{2}(\overline{\mathcal{M}}_g,\mathbb{Q})$](https://175.png)

where $\lambda$](https://176.png) is the Hodge class $c_{1}(\mathbb{E})$](https://177.png) and $\delta_{i}$](https://178.png) is the class Poincare-dual to the boundary divisor $\Delta_{i}$](https://19.png). The slope of the divisor $L$](https://10.png) is $s(L)
= \frac{a}{\mathrm{min}b_{i}}$](https://179.png). The slope conjecture states that

![$\displaystyle s_{g} = \mathrm{inf}_{L, a\neq 0}s(L) \geq 6 + \frac{12}{g+1}.$](https://180.png)

For $g \leq 22$](https://181.png) this would imply that the Kodaira dimension of $\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g}$](https://173.png) is $-\infty$](https://115.png). As it happens, Farkas and Popa have recently constructed several counterexamples to the slope conjecture. However, one can still ask for other weaker lower bounds on $s_{g}$](https://182.png). It is known that $s_{g} \geq 4$](https://183.png).
