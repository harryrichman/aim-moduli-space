title: Witten's Conjecture
---

Witten's conjecture is a recursive constraint for top intersections of ![$ \psi$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img215.png)-classes on ![$ \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img17.png). More precisely, if one considers the generating function

![$\displaystyle F_g = \sum_{n\geq 0} \frac{1}{n!} \left( \sum_{k_1,\ldots,k_n}
\i...
...cal{M}}_{g,n}} \psi_1^{k_1} \cdots \psi_n^{k_n} \right)
t_{k_1}\cdots t_{k_n},
$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img216.png)

Setting ![$ F= \sum_{g}\lambda^{2g-2}F_{g}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img217.png), Witten's conjecture is that ![$ Z=\mathrm{exp} F$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img218.png) is annihilated by a certain partial differential operator that also arises in studying the KdV equation in soliton theory. It can be restated as a specialization of the Virasoro conjecture for the case where ![$ X$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img1.png) is a point.

Multiple proofs of this conjecture now exist, due to Kontsevich, Okounkov-Pandharipande, and most recently Mirzakhani.
