These are geometrically defined intermediate subvarieties between $\mathcal M_{g, n}$ and $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g, n}$ whose topology and tautological rings may also have a nice structure. They include the moduli space $\mathcal M_{g, n}^c$ of curves of compact type (i.e. $\overline{\mathcal M}_{g, n} - \Delta_0$, or those curves whose dual graph is a tree), $\mathcal M_{g, n}^{\leq k}$ (curves with $\leq k$ rational components), and $\mathcal M_{g, n}^\mathrm{rat}$ (curves consisting of a single genus $g$ components attached to trees of rational tails).
