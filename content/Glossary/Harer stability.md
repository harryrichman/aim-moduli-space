Harer stability states that the degree ![$ d$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img76.png) homology of the [[Mapping class group|mapping class group]] ![$ \Gamma_{g,n}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img77.png) is independent of ![$ g$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img46.png) and ![$ n$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img68.png) if ![$ d$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img76.png) is small compared to ![$ g$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img46.png). More precisely, consider the following maps on [[Classifying space|classifying spaces]]. First, we construct a map ![$ B\Gamma_{g,b}
\rightarrow B\Gamma_{g,b-1}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img78.png) by adjoining a disk to a given boundary component. Second, we can construct a map ![$ B\Gamma_{g,b} \rightarrow
B\Gamma_{g+1,b}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img79.png) by gluing a torus with two boundary components along a given boundary component of our original Riemann surface. Harer's stability theorem asserts that both of these maps induce an isomorphism on ![$ H_{d}(-,\mathbb{Z})$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img80.png) for ![$ 2d < g-1$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img81.png). In particular, it allows us to talk about the stable homology/cohomology of the moduli space of curves, as in Mumford's conjecture.
