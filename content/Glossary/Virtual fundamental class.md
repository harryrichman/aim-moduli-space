title: Virtual fundamental class
---

The moduli space of maps ![$ \overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}(X,\beta)$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img69.png) is highly singular, and yet it has a homology class which behaves much like a fundamental class, and is hence called the virtual fundamental class ![$ [\overline{\mathcal{M}}_{g,n}(X,\beta)]^{\mathrm{vir}}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img211.png) defined in terms of the deformation theory of stable maps to ![$ X$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img1.png). The Gromov-Witten invariants of ![$ X$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img1.png) are defined by integrating various geometric cohomology classes over this class.
