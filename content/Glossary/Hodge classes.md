These are the Chern classes of the [[Hodge bundle]] ![$ \mathbb{E}$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img83.png); that is, ![$ \lambda_k = c_k(\mathbb{E})$](https://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/glossary/img84.png). They live in the cohomology of either the compactified or non-compactified moduli space.
