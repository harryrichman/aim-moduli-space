The point of view of [[Glossary/Tautological rings|tautological rings]] as minimal subalgebras satisfying certain conditions in explained in [ [Vak03]](Bibliography#Vak03), [ [FP00]](Bibliography#FP00), [ [GV03]](Bibliography#GV03), [ [FP03]](Bibliography#FP03), [ [GP03]](Bibliography#GP03). The introductions and selected parts of these articles are fairly accessible.
