As a point of entry, there is the introductory book by Harris and Morrison, [ [HM98]](Bibliography#HM98). Moving towards the research front, two excellent expository papers on this material are those by Vakil [ [Vak03]](Bibliography#Vak03) and Corti [ [Cor97]](Bibliography#Cor97). Further details can be found in the survey papers of Faber and Looijenga [ [FL99]](Bibliography#FL99) and Hain and Looijenga [ [HL97]](Bibliography#HL97). Those interested in the construction of the moduli space should see [ [Edi00]](Bibliography#Edi00), which contains an excellent introduction to both [[Deligne-Mumford stack | Deligne-Mumford stacks]] and geometric invariant theory, and also constructs the moduli stack and moduli space of curves.
