This document is a compilation of suggested canonical references for various topics related to the moduli space of curves. It was produced as part of the activities during the Topology and Geometry of the Moduli space of Curves workshop in March 2005; it is a component of a larger resource site atÂ [http://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/](http://www.aimath.org/WWN/modspacecurves/)

This document is meant to serve both as a guide to new people entering the field and also as an aid for those coming from either an algebraic geometry or a topological background and wishing to learn something about the other side. The content here is derived from material contributed by participants prior to the workshop.
