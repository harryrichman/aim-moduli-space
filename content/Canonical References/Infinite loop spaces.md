The topological approach to understanding the moduli space of curves is partly built upon the language of basic stable homotopy and [[Infinite loop space|infinite loop spaces]], so it is probably wise to know at least a little about the language of infinite loop spaces. The book of Adams [ [Ada78]](Bibliography#Ada78) is highly readable and its first few chapters are certainly the place to begin. For the relation between monoidal categories and infinite loop spaces, Segal's original two papers [ [Seg68]](Bibliography#Seg68) and [ [Seg74]](Bibliography#Seg74) make for good reading, and May's paper [ [May74]](Bibliography#May74) states the theorems of the subject nicely.
