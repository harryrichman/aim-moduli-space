These are compactifications of the [[Hurwitz schemes|Hurwitz scheme]] that are smooth and very important for computations of intersection numbers. This is covered in [ [HM98]](Bibliography#HM98), but the "stacky" point of view, as presented in [ [ACV03]](Bibliography#ACV03) is critical because it produces a smooth proper moduli stack.
