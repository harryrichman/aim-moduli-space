By considering the moduli space of stable maps (of relative stable maps) from a curve of genus $g$ to the projective line, one can use (virtual) localization techniques to get relations in the [[Glossary/Tautological rings|tautological ring]] of the moduli space of curves (or pointed curves). The principal references for this method are [ [GV03]](Bibliography#GV03) and [ [Kat03]](Bibliography#Kat03).
