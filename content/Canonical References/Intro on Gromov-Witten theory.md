The standard reference here is Fulton and Pandharipande's notes [ [FP97]](Bibliography#FP97). However, it might also be worth looking at Kock and Vainsencher [ [KV]](Bibliography#KV), which presents a more gentle introduction, covering the moduli space of maps, [[Gromov-Witten invariants]] and [[Quantum cohomology|quantum cohomology]].
